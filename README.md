# Introduction

This code was created to showcase a few of the capabilities of the upcoming C#11 release.

It demonstrates:

 - Generic Maths
 - Improved Initialisation/`required` Properties
 - The expanded scope of `nameof`
 - Raw strings

# Disclaimer

I threw this code together quickly purely for the demo.

It's not particularly well crafted, and there are definitely no tests. Please don't take this as representative of the kind of code I normally write...

At the time of writing, these features were all in preview too, so they might get scrapped or the syntax may change by the time the framework is actually released.
